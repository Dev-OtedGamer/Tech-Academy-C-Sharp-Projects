# My Projects
welcome to my GitHub! here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning C#:

## Project 1: [Anonymous Income Comparison](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/AnonymousIncomeComparison/AnonymousIncomeComparison/Program.cs#L3)
**Description:** A console application that allows users to input the weekly hours worked and hourly pay for two individuals. The program compares their incomes by calculating and comparing their annual earnings based on hours worked and pay rate. It then displays which person earns more annually.

## Project 2: ðŸŽ® [Arrays Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Arrays%20Submission%20Assignment/Arrays%20Submission%20Assignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console-based game created as part of an arrays assignment. Players face off against 3 to 12 different animals in battle, with enemy types and locations determined by user-selected numbers that correspond to values stored in arrays.

## Project 3: ðŸŽ® [Bool Comparison Game App](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Boolean%20Comparison%20Game%20App/Boolean%20Comparison%20Game%20App/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console-based adventure game built using turn-based progression inspired by classic MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons). The player chooses their path at key decision points, with outcomes that lead to treasure, safety, or deathâ€”based entirely on the choices made throughout the game.

## Project 4: [Console Application Challenge](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ConsoleApplicationChallenge/ConsoleApplicationChallenge/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console application that performs multiple mathematical operations based on user input. Users enter numbers, and the program calculates and displays results for a variety of equations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Project 5: [Insurance Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Insurance%20Assignment/Insurance%20Assignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console application that functions as an insurance approval tool. It prompts the user to input their age, DUI history, and number of speeding tickets. Based on these inputs, the program determines whether the user qualifies for insurance coverage and displays the result.
