# My Projects
welcome to my GitHub! here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning C#:

## Project 1: [Anonymous Income Comparison](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/AnonymousIncomeComparison/AnonymousIncomeComparison/Program.cs#L3)
**Description:** A console application that allows users to input the weekly hours worked and hourly pay for two individuals. The program compares their incomes by calculating and comparing their annual earnings based on hours worked and pay rate. It then displays which person earns more annually.

## Project 2: ðŸŽ® [Arrays Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Arrays%20Submission%20Assignment/Arrays%20Submission%20Assignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console-based game created as part of an arrays assignment. Players face off against 3 to 12 different animals in battle, with enemy types and locations determined by user-selected numbers that correspond to values stored in arrays.

## Project 3: ðŸŽ® [Bool Comparison Game App](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Boolean%20Comparison%20Game%20App/Boolean%20Comparison%20Game%20App/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console-based adventure game built using turn-based progression inspired by classic MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons). The player chooses their path at key decision points, with outcomes that lead to treasure, safety, or deathâ€”based entirely on the choices made throughout the game.

## Project 4: [Console Application Challenge](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ConsoleApplicationChallenge/ConsoleApplicationChallenge/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console application that performs multiple mathematical operations based on user input. Users enter numbers, and the program calculates and displays results for a variety of equations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Project 5: [Insurance Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Insurance%20Assignment/Insurance%20Assignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A console application that functions as an insurance approval tool. It prompts the user to input their age, DUI history, and number of speeding tickets. Based on these inputs, the program determines whether the user qualifies for insurance coverage and displays the result.

## Project 6: [Lambda Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/LambdaSubmission/LambdaSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that works with a custom Employee class list. It uses both a traditional foreach loop and modern LINQ with lambda expressions to filter and display employees named "Joe". Additionally, it uses a lambda expression to display all employees with ID numbers greater than 5.

## Project 7: [Package Express app](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Package%20Express%20app/Package%20Express%20app/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that checks if a user's package exceeds shipping size or weight limits. The user enters the packageâ€™s weight and dimensions, and the application determines whether the package qualifies for shipment based on predefined service restrictions.

## Project 8: [Student Daily Report](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/StudentDailyReport/StudentDailyReport/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that allows students to submit daily progress reports. Students can log their current status, topics covered, and any struggles theyâ€™re facing in the curriculum.

## Project 9: ðŸŽ® [Switch Statement Challenge](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Switch%20Statement%20Challenge/Switch%20Statement%20Challenge/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that uses a switch statement to create a simple interactive game. The user's choice to determine different outcomes, making it a fun way to demonstrate control flow in C#.

## Project 10: [Try-Catch Integer Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Try-Catch%20Integer%20Assignment/Try-Catch%20Integer%20Assignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that demonstrates exception handling using try/catch/finally while performing a division operation on a list of integers.

## Project 11: [Twenty One](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne/Program.cs)
**Description:** This is the beginning phase of a Blackjack game. It includes a randomized shuffle for a deck of cards, assigning appropriate values to both numbered and face cards. This setup lays the groundwork for future gameplay logic, including dealing, scoring, and win conditions.

## Project 12: [Date Time Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/dateTimeSubmission/dateTimeSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** A simple C# console application that allows the user to input a number of hours. The program then calculates and displays the future date and time based on the current system time plus the entered hours.

## Project 13: [main Method Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/mainMethodSubmission/mainMethodSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that demonstrates method overloading by accepting an int, decimal, and string input. It performs different operations (add, multiply, subtract) on the input using a custom Math class, showcasing how the same method name can handle different data types.

## Project 14: [method Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/methodSubmissionAssignment/methodSubmissionAssignment/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that demonstrates a method with optional parameters. The user is asked to input one or two numbers. If only one number is provided, the method performs an operation using just that number; if two are provided, it uses both. This showcases method overloading or default parameter functionality using a custom Math class.

## Project 15: [operators Overload Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/edit/main/operatorsOverloadSubmission/operatorsOverloadSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that demonstrates operator overloading. It compares Employee objects based on their EmpID using overloaded == and != operators. The program shows whether different Employee instances are considered equal or not by comparing their IDs.

## Project 16: [parameters Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/parametersSubmission/parametersSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** A C# console application that demonstrates the use of generic classes. It creates two Employee objectsâ€”one with a List<string> and another with a List<int>â€”and displays their contents. This shows how a generic class can handle different data types using the same structure.

## Project 17: [parsing Enums Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/parsingEnumsSubmission/parsingEnumsSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** This is a simple console application that prompts the user to enter the current day of the week. The user can input either the name of the day (e.g., "Monday") or a number representing the day (e.g., 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).

## Project 18: [polymorphism Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/polymorphismSubmission/polymorphismSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** This program demonstrates polymorphism in C# through the use of an interface called IQuittable and a class Employee that implements this interface.

## Project 19: [void Division Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/voidDivisionSubmission/voidDivisionSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** This C# program performs a variety of mathematical operations using a class called Math. It demonstrates key concepts such as: Void methods, Out parameters, Method overloading, and Static methods.

## Project 20: [void Method Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/voidMethodSubmission/voidMethodSubmission/Program.cs)
**Description:** This C# console application demonstrates how to use a void method that accepts two parameters, performs a simple calculation with the first parameter, and displays both values.
